                <p>We are inviting you to participate in a research study on the development of new helper tools for block-based programmers.</p>
                <p>Your parent(s)/guardian(s) know we are talking with you about the study. This form will tell you about the study to help you decide whether or not you want to participate in this research.</p>
                <p><strong>What is the purpose of this research study?</strong></p>
                <p>This study hopes to determine the usefulness of the new helper tools by understanding how students plan and program block-based programming projects. From this study, we have to learn how to help block-based programmers creatively plan and complete projects.</p>
                <p><strong>What will I do in this study?</strong></p>
                <p>You will do one to three of the following programming sessions:</p>
                <p>1). You may start programming by making plans.</p>
                <p>2). After finishing planning, you  may answer mid-survey questions. Answering the mid-survey questions may take 3-10 minutes.</p>
                <p>3) Next, You will do programming in a block-based programming environment.</p>
                <p>4) After finishing programming, you may answer post-survey questions. Answering the post-survey questions may take 3-10 minutes.</p>
                <p>5) We may conduct 1-1 interviews with you to understand your programming experience. Interviews may take 5-15 minutes. The interviews will be conducted over Zoom. We may record your voice and computer screen during the interviews.</p>
                <p>As a normal part of the program you will do 1) and 3). Additionally for research purposes only, you will be asked to 2), 4) and 5). We are asking permission to use the following as data for research:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Mid and Post surveys, we will only collect your deidentified user ID.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Audio and screen recording of the programming session. During screen recording, you will have your video off (not showing your faces), and change your Zoom user names to your deidentified IDs during the study.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Log data from the programming environment. It will logged under your de-identified User ID.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Notes taken by the experimenter during the procedure.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Your plans and programs, under your deidentified user ID.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>de-identified user ID: When you complete the consent/assent, you will be assigned an de-identified user ID (e.g., a city name), which you will use for the rest of the study. You will also be asked to change your Zoom user names temporarily to the user ID we assigned to them.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>We will not record videos of your faces.</p>
                <p><strong>Can I participate in this study?</strong></p>
                <p>You are invited to participate in this study if you agree to be in this study, are able to read English, and you have shared the parental opt-out letter with your parents and your parents decided to not opt out.</p>
                <p>You cannot participate in this study if you do not want to participate in this study, your parent or guardian does not want you in this study, or you are not able to read English.</p>
                <p><strong>What benefits do I get for participating in this study?</strong></p>
                <p>By taking part in this study, you may learn new methods for planning your programming projects. Additionally, it will help us learn the impact of our new programming helper tools and how to improve them for future users.</p>
                <p><strong>Can anything bad happen if I am in this study?</strong></p>
                <p>There are minimal foreseeable risks associated with this study.</p>
                <p><strong>Will anyone know what I said or did in this study?</strong></p>
                <p>If you decide to be in the study, we will not tell anyone else how you respond or act as part of the study. This means that no one outside of the researchers will know that it is you. Even if your parents ask, we will not tell them about what you say or do in the study. Everything will remain private. In the rare and unusual circumstance that we think someone else is hurting you or you are in danger, we are required by law to tell someone only enough information in order to help you be safe.</p>
                <p><strong>Will you share what you learn about/from me with other people?</strong></p>
                <p>We plan to share de-identified information that we learn from you with others on how your experience was with our programming help support. We also want to keep the information that we learn about you indefinitely for future research purposes.</p>
                <p><strong>Do I have to be in the study?</strong></p>
                <p>No, you do not. The choice is yours. No one will get angry or upset if you do not share your data. You will not miss anything if you do not want to do this. You can also change your mind anytime if you decide that you do or do not want to be in the study. You will still be able to participate in programming activities, but you will not complete the surveys.</p>
                <p><strong>What if I have questions?</strong></p>
                <p>If you have questions about the study, you can ask us now or anytime during the study. You can also call us at Wengran Wang (<a href="mailto:wwang33@ncsu.edu">wwang33@ncsu.edu</a>, 9193896416) and the Faculty Sponsor: Dr. Thomason William Price (twprice@ncsu.edu, 9196192390).</p>
                <p>If you have any questions about your rights as a participant in this research or if you feel you have been hurt by this research, you can contact the IRB Office at <a href="mailto:irb-director@ncsu.edu">irb-director@ncsu.edu</a> or (919) 515-8754. You will receive a copy of this form for your records.</p>
