Now, we want you to think about a sequence of actions and what starts and stops each action. This is a very important problem decomposition technique that programmers use to break down problems that involve multiple entities interacting together.</em></p>\n<p>A series of actions by multiple sprites can be decomposed based on the order in which the actions occur and the conditions that cause one action to stop and another to start. </p>\n<p>To decompose a project into a sequence of actions, it is necessary to identify the actions that occur based on certain events.</p>\n<p>for example, check the below project:\nThis project looks pretty complicated, but it is not if you separate it into different parts of sub-components. </p>\n<p>Your Task: do the following warm-up exercise to match different actors in the below different games with the corresponding event, including <b>triggers</b> and <b>actions</b>.</p>\n"
